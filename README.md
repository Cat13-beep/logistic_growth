# Question 1) 
**Information and Results for the Logistic Growth Analysis**

<ins>Analysis information:</ins> This data analysis is based on estimating parameters relating to the growth of a bacteria population in media- the parameters that are being investigated include the initial population size of the bacteria (N0), rate of growth (r), and the carrying capacity (K). In addition, the data is fitted to logistic and exponential models to see which describes the data best. I am using the experiment.csv data file, from the Open Science Framework's website- logistic growth data by contributor Jose Gabriel Nino Barreat (in my repo as experiment.csv). This data includes results from a single, simulated bacteria growth experiment.

I edited the code for the analysis in the fit_linear_model.R, plot_data.R, and plot_data_and_model.R files in this logistic_growth repository. This analysis included using the differential equation describing logistic growth to determine the three parameters under investigation. When K is much greater than N0 and t is small (case 1) the graph has exponential properties and an exponential equation can represent the growth. Additionally, for high T values, the bacteria's population size is at carrying capacity (case 2). These assumptions of the growth of bacteria mean that it is possible to estimate the three parameter values (N0, r, and K) using linear approximations. Rearranging an exponential equation, N(t)=N0e<sup>rt</sup>, for case 1 gives the linear regression equation ln(N)= ln(N0)+rt. So when plotting the data using a linear model function with logged y-axis variable, bacterial population size, and time on the x-axis, the parameters (gradient and y-intercept) can be found. Therefore, from the regression analysis output, the intercept estimate will be ln(N0) (from which N0 can be determined) and r is the estimate for the gradient. In case 2 described above K can be determined by putting a large value of T into the regression input, the size of the population at this high value of T will be constant, and the carrying capacity (K). 

<ins>Results:</ins> Therefore, in my analysis, I started by plotting the data (using the code from plot_data.R), the data shows typical trends for logistic data. The first graph with time on the x-axis and  the number of cells on the y-axis shows a small population of bacteria until about the 1500 time point, then there is rapid population growth until about the time point 2000, where the growth rate slows and the population size plateaus. The second semi-logged graph (with a logged number of cells on the y-axis) shows linear growth from time points 0 to 2000, at which point the population size plateaus. 

When fitting the linear model to the data part of the analysis I first inputted a small value of t (600)- the output of the linear regression estimate for the intercept is 6.869 (this value is ln(N0)), to get just N0 estimate I took the exponent which is 961.986 (3.d.p). The estimate for the gradient is 0.0101 given from the same regression output, which, for the reasons described above, relates directly to the r-value. For the next regression (case 2), I used a large value of t, within the region of the graph where there is a plateau- 2100. The estimate for the intercept (the prediction of the carrying capacity) is 5.993e+10 (5.993×10<sup>10</sup>). **Therefore my parameter estimates are N0= 961.986, r= 0.0101, and K= 5.993×10^10**

For the final bit of analysis (plot_data_and_model.R) a model with my estimates for the parameters produced a graph that is the correct shape of the logistic model and runs through the points from the data set- the red line of the model crosses through these points. This same outcome is seen, that the data points and the logistic model are in the same shape (as with the first graph) on the semi-logged logistic graph. As the data points and logistic model follow a similar shape it suggests the values I have found for the estimates of these parameters are correct.

# Question 2) 
**Comparing Exponential and Logistic Models**

Population size at a certain time point (4980) assuming exponential growth can be done using the exponential model equation- N(t)= N0e<sup>rt</sup> using my parameters for N0 and r. This creates the equation 961.986e^0.0101x4980 = 6.719x10<sup>24</sup> bacterial population size. Compared to the logistic model this is much larger. The logistic model plateaus off at high t values- at around 2000 minutes in this data set, which is better as it is a more realistic picture of bacterial growth as they have limited space and nutrients. Therefore, the predicted population size of bacteria by the logistic model at this time would be the carrying capacity mentioned above (5.993e+10 bacteria). 

# Question 3)
**Graph Comparing Exponential and Logistic Models**

Comparing the exponential and logistic graphs side by side, I used similar code to the one already in the R-file in the folder plot_data_and_model.R and adapted it so it showed exponential instead of the logistic model- using the parameters required for an exponential model- N0 and r (same values as used for the logistic model), then I arranged the two model graphs to be side by side on the same plot. The code that I used is in a newly created folder in this logistic_growth repo called question3code.R. The graph that this produced, which allows comparison between the logistic and exponential model is here below and in the repo folder Rplot.png.

This graph shows that the exponential graph (blue line) infinitely increases at an increasing rate, in contrast, the logistic model (red line) plateaus at a certain time, at around 2000 minutes, so that the population size of the bacteria remains constant.
