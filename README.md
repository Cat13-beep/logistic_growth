Question 1) I used observations about the models to get estimates on three parameters. Using the experiment.csv, I found that the parameters are... N0 (bacteria population size at the time 0) is 6.87 (963 if removed from the log) from the intercept estimate in case 1. #r (the intrinsic growth rate of the bacteria) is 0.0101 given as an estimate for t in case 1. K (carrying capacity) is 5.993e+10, given as an estimate for the intercept in the model for case 2. The graph produced with these parameters looks like a logistic model.
Question 2)Population size assuming exponential growth at a certain time can be done using the exponential model equation- N(t)= N0e^rt using my parameters this is 963e^0.0101*4980 = 6.7*10^24, compared to the logistic model this is much larger, as the logistic model plateaus off at high t values and therefore predicts the population size of bacteria at this time would be the carrying capacity mentioned above (5.993e+10). 
Question 3) Comparing the exponential and logistic graphs side by side
